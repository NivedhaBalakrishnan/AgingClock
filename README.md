# AgingClock
The Aging Clock project strives to create a simple website that predicts a biological age of an individual given his blood work data with the help of Deep Learning. 
The model is trained using PyTorch and Scikit-learn libraries on GCP's Vetrex AI instances with the publicly available NHANES datasets provided by CDC. For deployment and hosting tools such as Voila, Jupyter Notebooks, Ipywidgets, and Vultr are used.
