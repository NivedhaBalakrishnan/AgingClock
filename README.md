# AgingClock
The Aging Clock project strives to create a simple website that predicts a biological age of an individual given his blood work data with the help of Deep Learning. The model is trained using PyTorch and Scikit-learn libraries on GCP's Vetrex AI instances with the data coming from Google Cloud Storage. Other DevOps tools include Github/Zenhub and Docker for smooth development as well as easier deployment, and Jupyter, Voila and Binder are utilized for visualization, web development and hosting respectively
